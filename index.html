                If you are new to yoga, there are a few key things you should know. Most importantly,
                it's essential to familiarize yourself with the basic poses to feel comfortable practicing
                both in a group setting and on your own. Our program fee covers accommodation, meals,

                <h3>Improves Physical Health</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Yoga enhances overall physical health by promoting flexibility, strength, and balance. Regular
                    practice of yoga poses,
                    or asanas, stretches and tones the muscles, improving joint flexibility and reducing the risk of
                    injuries.
                    Additionally, yoga strengthens the core muscles, which helps in maintaining good posture and
                    preventing back pain.
                    Studies have shown that yoga can also lower blood pressure,
                    improve cardiovascular health, and boost the immune system, contributing to a healthier body.</p>

                <h3>Reduces Stress and Anxiety</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>One of the most celebrated benefits of yoga is its ability to reduce stress and anxiety. Yoga
                    incorporates
                    various breathing techniques, known as pranayama, which help calm the mind and promote relaxation.
                    The combination of physical movement and focused breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous
                    system,
                    which lowers the body's stress response. Regular practice of yoga can lead to a significant
                    reduction in cortisol levels,
                    the primary stress hormone, fostering a sense of peace and well-being.</p>

            <div id="benefits-mental">
                <h3>Enhances Mental Clarity and Focus</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Yoga is not just a physical practice but also a mental one. Through meditation and mindful movement,
                    yoga helps sharpen mental clarity and improve concentration. The practice encourages present-moment
                    awareness,
                    which can enhance cognitive functions and decision-making skills. Regular yoga practitioners often
                    report improved
                    memory and mental sharpness, as the practice trains the mind to stay
                    focused and reduces the clutter of distracting thoughts.</p>

            <div id="benefits-stability">
                <h3>Promotes Emotional Stability</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Yoga has profound effects on emotional health.
                    The practice encourages self-awareness and introspection, allowing individuals to understand and
                    manage
                    their emotions better. The meditative aspects of yoga help cultivate a positive outlook on life and
                    improve
                    emotional resilience. Furthermore, the sense of community and support found in group yoga classes
                    can reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation, promoting a sense of belonging and emotional
                    well-being.</p>
